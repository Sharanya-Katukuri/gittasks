CLONNING A REPOSITORY:
Cloning means copying a GitHub repository to our local machine so you can work on it.
1.Copy the repository link
Go to the GitHub repo → Click Code → Copy HTTPS link
Example: https://github.com/username/repo.git
2.Open terminal or command prompt
Go to the folder where you want to save the project:
cd path/to/folder
3.Run the clone command
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
4.Go inside the cloned folder
cd repo
Done! Now you have the repository on our computer and can start working on it.
